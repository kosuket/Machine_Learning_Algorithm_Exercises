Final Project for COMSCI260 Machine Learning Algorithms at UCLA Engineering School

Overview
This program is developed for the final project for COMSCI260 Machine Learning Algorithms at UCL Engineering School.
The project scope is to develop a neural network algorithm and a k-nearest neighbor algorithm 
to best classify a medical data that has datetime + two other features.

Library Requirement
The following python libraries are required: sys, os, numpy, random, and math

Arguments and Files
Argument 1
Both final_project_neuralnet.py and final_project_knn.py takes an argument, the folder name, 
that includes an absolute path to the folder and folder name (i.e. /Users/XXX/Academic/CS260/outDataClass)
The specified folder is required to contain csv files as input files that contain data points of a patient
and the first line should be the label. Files needs to be named as PersonName_class (i.e. 2_0.csv).
The class needs to be either 0 or 1.
The csv file must contain 3 columns in the following order: date, feature_a, feature_b.

Argument 2
Additionally, final_project_knn.py can take one more argument, k. k is set to 1 by default.

Output
As an output, it prints metrics including 
Average Accuracy
Average Precision
Average Recall
Average Sensitivity
Average Specificity
Average F measure
Average Confusion Matrix
data points for ROC Curve (100 - specificity, sensitivity)
